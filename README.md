# 12-employee-tracker-tool
A command-line application for a company database. This app uses Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Description

This is challenge hw #12.
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the Video Submission Guide on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on creating a video.


### User Story

### Getting started

You’ll need to use the MySQL2 package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line, and the console.table package(https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.



You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the npm documentation on MySQL2
